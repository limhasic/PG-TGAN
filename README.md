# Integrating Progressive Growing and Categorical Techniques for Enhanced GAN Performance

## Abstract

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved notable success in generative modeling but still face challenges in training stability and handling categorical data. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Progressive Growing GAN (PG-GAN) with Categorical GAN (CTGAN) techniques. By leveraging PG-GAN’s progressive training strategy to improve stability and CTGAN’s robust handling of categorical variables, our method enhances both the quality of generated data and the efficiency of the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional GAN variants in terms of data generation quality and training stability.

## 1. Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have transformed generative modeling by learning to create realistic data samples. However, GANs often struggle with training instability and inefficiencies when handling categorical data. Progressive Growing GAN (PG-GAN) addresses stability through a progressive learning approach, while Categorical GAN (CTGAN) introduces effective techniques for handling categorical variables.

This paper proposes an innovative integration of PG-GAN and CTGAN techniques to combine their respective advantages. Our approach aims to enhance the stability and versatility of GANs by progressively growing the network's capacity while effectively managing categorical variables. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model through a series of experiments and comparisons with existing GAN architectures.

### 2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks

GANs, introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), consist of a Generator and a Discriminator that are trained adversarially to generate high-quality samples from complex distributions. Despite their success, GANs are known for their training instability and difficulties in generating realistic data with categorical features.

### 2.2 Progressive Growing GAN

PG-GAN (Karras et al., 2018) improves training stability and sample quality by starting with low-resolution images and gradually increasing the resolution. This progressive approach allows the network to refine generated samples step-by-step, leading to higher fidelity outputs and improved training stability.

### 2.3 Categorical GAN (CTGAN)

CTGAN (Yu et al., 2019) focuses on generating realistic data with categorical variables by introducing techniques such as embedding layers and mini-batch discrimination. These methods enhance the model’s ability to handle discrete features effectively and improve the quality of generated samples.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overview

We propose a novel hybrid model, PG-CTGAN, which combines PG-GAN’s progressive growing approach with CTGAN’s techniques for handling categorical data. This integration aims to improve both the quality of generated samples and the stability of the training process.

### 3.2 Progressive Growing

Our approach uses a progressive training strategy where the Generator and Discriminator start with lower-dimensional data and gradually increase the complexity. This allows the model to focus on generating coarse features initially and progressively refine them, leading to improved stability and output quality.

### 3.3 Categorical Data Handling

Incorporating techniques from CTGAN, our model includes embedding layers to effectively process categorical variables. We also apply mini-batch discrimination to enhance the model’s ability to distinguish between real and generated samples, improving overall performance.

### 3.4 Network Architecture

- **Generator**: The Generator begins with a latent vector and generates data through progressively deeper layers. The architecture is designed to handle both continuous and categorical data effectively.
- **Discriminator**: The Discriminator is trained to differentiate between real and generated samples, utilizing techniques for improved stability and handling of categorical inputs.

Our experiments demonstrate that PG-CTGAN outperforms existing models in generating high-quality samples and maintaining training stability. The integration of progressive growing and categorical handling techniques leads to superior performance across different datasets.

### 4.3 Analysis

The combination of PG-GAN’s progressive learning and CTGAN’s categorical data handling effectively addresses common issues in GAN training. The use of embedding layers and mini-batch discrimination further enhances the quality and stability of the generated data.
